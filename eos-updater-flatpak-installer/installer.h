 * @EU_INSTALLER_MODE_STAMP: Just update the counter files to the most

 *                           files but don't perform actions. This is typically

 *                           that is that all flatpaks that should have been
 *                           installed are installed and all flatpaks that

 *                           tool, because a user can legitimately uninstall
 *                           or install flatpaks of the same name after
 *                           an update has occurred.
