.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.\"
\fBeos\-updater\-flatpak\-autoinstall.d\fP provides a list of ‘flatpak ref action’
files, which specify flatpaks that should be installed, updated and uninstalled
by \fBeos\-updater\-flatpak\-installer\fP(8) when booting into a new deployment.
.PP
Configuration files take priority over each other in the directory descending
order listed above. If a file in a higher priority directory has the same
basename as a file in a lower priority directory, only the configuration from
the higher priority directory is used. The list of actions to apply is
determined first sorting the new actions in each file ascending by its
serial number, then by sorting the files in lexicographical order
and concatenating their sorted contents to each other. This means that the
most up-to-date action in a filename that is lexicographically ordered after
another filename will take priority in the event that the two
most up-to-date actions conflict, even if the most up-to-date action in the
lower-priority file has a newer
serial number.
.\"
.SH ACTION SPECIFICATION
.IX Header "FILE FORMAT"
.\"
The file format of each ‘flatpak ref action’ file in a
\fBeos\-updater\-flatpak\-autoinstall.d(5)\fP directory is
RFC\ 7159 compliant JSON. Each file must be a JSON array containing
objects describing a ‘flatpak ref action’, as described below in
\fBFlatpak Ref Action\fP. These files are intended to be append-only
and the \fB"serial"\P property in each object must be a monotonically
increasing counter within the domain of that filename.
.\"
.IP "\fIFlatpak Ref Action\fP"
.IX Flatpak Ref Action
.\"
A JSON object containing, at minimum, properties \fB"action"\fP,
\fB"serial"\fP and optionally \fB"filters"\fP. Valid values for
\fB"action"\fP are \fB"install"\fP, and \fB"uninstall"\fP, each having
their own required properties as explained below. The only valid type
for \fB"serial"\fP, is an integer, which must be monotonically
increasing as new entries are appended to the file.
.\"
.IP "\fIThe "filters" entry\fP"
.IX Action filters
.\"
A \fB"\fIFlatpak Ref Action\fP"\fP may have a \fB"filters"\fP entry which
is a JSON object with properties \fB"architectures"\fP, \fB"~architectures"\fP,
\fB"locales"\fP and \fB"~locales"\fP. Each filter property takes a JSON
array of strings containing architectures or locales to apply to the filter.
.\"
Where a filter is prefixed with a tilde (~), the action will not be applied
if the system architecture or locales matches any entry in the array. Otherwise,
the action will only be applied if the system architectures or locales matches
at least one entry in the array.
.\"
Where an action is filtered out and not applied, it will never be applied
again, even if the property being filtered on changes. For instance, if the
system locale changes, the action will not be re-evaluated to see if it
matches the new locale.
.\"
.IP "\fI"install" actions\fP"
.IX Install action
.\"
Where the fB"\action\fP"\fP property of a "\fBFlatpak Ref Action\fP" entry is
"\fB"install"\fP", the action will describe a flatpak that should be
installed upon the next boot of the deployment in which the action was
introduced. The entry must have the additional properties "\fB"app"\fP",
"\fB"ref-kind"\fP" and both "\fB"collection-id"\fP" and "\fB"remote"\fP",
which describe the flatpak app ID, whether the flatpak is a
runtime or an app and either the \fBostree\fP(1) collection ID or remote to
install the app from. See \fBflatpak\fP(1) and \fBostree\fP(1) for more
information on flatpak app IDs, ref-kinds and remotes, and ostree(1)
on collection IDs generally. If the flatpak is already installed when the action
is applied, \fBeos-updater-flatpak-installer\fP(8) will attempt to upgrade it.
\."
Because both "\fB"collection-id"\fP" and "\fB"remote"\fP" are specified, the
updater will check that the given remote matches the first remote for
the given collection ID, otherwise an error occurrs. If neither
"\fB"collection-id"\fP" nor "\fB"remote"\fP" are specified, an error
occurrs.
\."
Note that flatpaks are not pulled from the remote upon booting into
the deployment, they are instead downloaded by \fBeos-updater\fP(8) during its
‘fetch’ step whilst it prepares the commit to be deployed.
\."
.IP "\fI"uninstall" actions\fP"
.IX Uninstall action
.\"
Where the fB"\action\fP"\fP property of a "\fBFlatpak Ref Action\fP" entry is
"\fB"uninstall"\fP", the action will describe a flatpak that should be
uninstalled upon the next boot of the deployment in which the action was
introduced. The entry must have the additional properties "\fB"app"\fP",
"\fB"ref-kind"\fP". It is not an error if the flatpak is already uninstalled
when the action is applied.
