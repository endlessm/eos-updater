/var/lib/eos-updater/flatpak-autoinstall.d/override/* and the counter state
in /var/lib/eos-application-tools/flatpak-autoinstall.progress, then for each
basename, perform only newly updated actions and save the most up to date
serial number for each file in

When set to \fBstamp\fP, \fBeos\-updater\-flatpak\-installer\fP will only save
the updated actions to
/var/lib/eos-application-tools/flatpak-autoinstall.progress. When set to
