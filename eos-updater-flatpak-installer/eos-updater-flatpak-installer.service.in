# Currently commented out. Changes in flatpak, ostree or systemd
# itself can easily break the flatpak installer by preventing it
# from doing what it needs to do. Every time this happens, it is
# a pain to debug, since we need to do a process of elimination
# to determine what system call was causing it to trip up. We
# need the flatpak installer to work correctly in order to ensure
# the integrity of updates and it should not fail because a change
# in security policy prevented it from working. Once flatpak, ostree
# and systemd stabilize a little more, we can reconsider enabling
# this option again.
