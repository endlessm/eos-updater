# Deployments
# These are the ref files which indicate which ref the various deployments we
# have are at. They are in the format:
#    ostree/$bootversion/$subbootversion/$deployindex
# See generate_deployment_refs() in ostree.git.
# The $bootversion and $subbootversion can both only ever be 0 or 1. The
# deployment index is an unbounded non-negative integer, but since we only
# ever expect two deployments (current booted one, and the previous or next
# one on upgrade), we just list 0 and 1.
