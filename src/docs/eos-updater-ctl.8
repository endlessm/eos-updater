.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.\"
\fBeos\-updater\-ctl\fP is a utility to manually control the update process of
\fBeos\-updater\fP(8), triggering it to move through states in the update
sequence. It accepts three main commands: \fBpoll\fP, \fBfetch\fP and
\fBapply\fP.
These correspond with the states described in \fBeos\-updater\fP(8), with each
command triggering a progression to the named state. Normally, the updater is
moved through these states automatically by \fBeos\-autoupdater\fP(8) —
\fBeos\-updater\-ctl\fP allows this to be done manually. Execution of the
command will block on successful progression through the named state unless the
\fB\-\-no\-block\fP option is provided: for example, the \fBfetch\fP command
will wait for an update to be downloaded rather than completing immediately.
.PP
If the \fBupdate\fP command is given, all three states will be moved through
in sequence.
.PP
If the \fBmonitor\fP command is given (or if no command is given),
\fBeos\-updater\-ctl\fP will monitor the state of
\fBeos\-updater\fP(8) until interrupted, printing out its D\-Bus properties
every time they change. If the updater disappears off the system bus,
\fBeos\-updater\-ctl\fP will wait until it reappears and will resume
monitoring.
.PP
The \fBserver\fP command is used to control the configuration of
\fBeos\-update\-server\fP(8). Its \fBenable\fP and \fBdisable\fP subcommands
make the necessary configuration and update changes to enable or disable
advertising and serving updates to computers on the local network.
.\"
.SH COMMANDS
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.\"
.IP "\fBapply\fP"
Deploy updates which were downloaded in the previous \fBfetch\fP stage, and
ready the computer to boot into an updated OSTree deployment when next rebooted.
This command does not reboot the computer.
.\"
.IP "\fBfetch\fP [\fB\-\-force\fP] [\fB\-\-timeout=\fPSECONDS]"
Download updates which were found in the previous \fBpoll\fP stage.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fP is specified, the download will proceed even if on a metered
network connection (when it might otherwise be paused according to the download
schedule; see \fBmogwai\-scheduled\fP(8)).
.IP
If \fB\-\-timeout\fP is specified, the client will wait at most the given
number of seconds to get permission to download from the scheduler. If
permission is not given before the timeout expires, an error will be returned.
A timeout of zero (the default) means to wait indefinitely.
.\"
.IP "\fBmonitor\fP"
Monitor the status of \fBeos\-updater\fP(8), printing its state changes and
D\-Bus name changes. Run until killed.
.\"
.IP "\fBpoll\fP"
Check all configured update sources for available updates.
.\"
.IP "\fBserver\fP [\fBenable\fP|\fBdisable\fP]\fP"
Enable or disable advertising and serving updates to the local network using
\fBeos\-update\-server\fP(8).
.\"
.IP "\fBupdate\fP [\fB\-\-force\fP] [\fB\-\-timeout=\fPSECONDS]"
Run all three update stages in sequence: poll, fetch, apply.
.IP
The \fB\-\-force\fP and \fB\-\-timeout\fP options apply only to the fetch stage
of the update process, and have the same meanings as for the \fBfetch\fP
command.
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-block\fP"
Do not wait for the given command to result in a state change in
\fBeos\-updater\fP(8); instead, return immediately. This is understood by the
\fBpoll\fP, \fBfetch\fP and \fBapply\fP commands.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-\-quiet\fP"
Output no informational messages; only errors.
