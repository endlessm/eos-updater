- replace dbuslib with corelib that only has a dependency on gio
  - maybe put there some code from tests misc-utils to deduplicate the code even more

- replace utillib with ostreelib that uses corelib and depends on
  ostree

- drop message in favor of g_message

- come up with a communication between eos-update-server and
  eos-updater, so eos-update-server does not serve outdated updates

- write some a bit more asynchronous code for fetching commit ids from LAN:

  - asynchronous fetches would have a shared state:

    - the latest commit id

    - a list of the LAN servers with the latest commit id

    - a set of old commit ids

  - from each LAN server fetch the
    <IP>:<PORT>/extensions/eos/refs.d/<REF> file

  - if the checksum in the download ref file is in the old commits id,
    then discard the LAN server

  - otherwise download the signature and validate it; if it fails,
    discard the LAN server

  - otherwise if the commit id is the same as the latest commit id
    then add the LAN server to the list

  - otherwise do the ostree pull with commit-only flag set and check
    the timestamp of the commit; if timestamp is old then add the
    checksum to old commits set and discard the LAN server

  - otherwise discard all the LAN servers in the list, add the current
    latest commit id to the old commits set and set the new latest
    commit id and add the LAN server to the LIST

- for real-world testing, come up with a master and slaves programs (a
  botnet, woo!)

  - slave would let the master know it exists under a specific address
    and a port and then listen on the port to accept some commands
    from master

    - check a sanity of the environment (avahi daemon running, ostree
      installed, eos-update-server installed, systemd as pid1)

      - eos-update-server would likely be distributed together with
        the slave or eos-updater project could be configured to build
        only the slave and the eos-update-server programs

    - setting up a fake sysroot with some specific commit (like we
      currently do in "make check")

    - setting up an avahi service file and systemd service and timer
      unit files

    - cleanup the mess

  - master would send the commands to the slaves and then run
    eos-updater and check the results

  - this would make sure that the following stuff works as expected
    (complementary to "make check"):

    - avahi discovery

    - systemd socket activation of the eos-update-server

- branch files are remote specific so they should be checked against a
  remote specific key

- refs file probably will have to store not only a checksum, but also
  a ref name they refer to, to avoid having a ref file in
  <EXTENSIONS>/refs.d/<REF_X> to point to a commit in REF_Y, have to
  check if we pass a ref name to ostree pull when fetching commit data

- test if branch files are preferred from the servers with signed
  branch data over the unsigned ones. Basically means to prefer v2 of
  the txt protocol over v1.

  - or simply drop the possibility of having the unsigned branch file,
    that would simplify the code

- store ostree path in the signed branch file, next to the timestamp

- add valgrind support in tests

- add some sanity tests to check if setting up the server and clients
  work
