.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.\"
\fBeos\-updater\-flatpak\-autoinstall.d\fP provides a list of "flatpak ref action"
files, which specify flatpaks that should be installed and removed
by \fBeos\-updater\-flatpak\-installer\fP(8) when booting into a new deployment.
.PP
The directories listed 
The configuration file contains a mandatory section, \fI[Download]\fP, and an
optional per\-source section, \fI[Source "volume"]\fP, whose keys are described
below.
.PP
Configuration files take priority over each other in the directory order
listed above. If a file in a higher priority directory has the same basename
as a file in a lower priority directory, only the configuration from
the higher priority directory is used. The list of actions to apply is
determined by appending all the new actions in each filename in
lexicographical order. This means that the most up-to-date action in
a filename that is lexicographically ordered after the another filename
will take priority in the event that the two most up-to-date actions conflict,
even if the most up-to-date action in the lower-priority file has a newer
serial number.
.\"
.SH ACTION SPECIFICATION
.IX Header "FILE FORMAT"
.\"
The file format of each "flatpak ref action" file in a
\fBeos\-updater\-flatpak\-autoinstall.d(5)\fP directory is
RFC7159 compliant JSON. Each file must be a JSON array containing
objects describing a "flatpak ref action", as described below in
\fBFlatpak Ref Action\fP. These files are intended to be append-only
and the \fB"serial"\P property in each object must be a monotonically
increasing counter within the domain of that filename.
.\"
.IP "\fIFlatpak Ref Action\fP"
.IX Flatpak Ref Action
.\"
A JSON object containing, at minimum, properties \fB"action"\fP,
\fB"serial"\fP and optionally \fB"filters"\fP. Valid values for
\fB"action"\fP are \fB"install"\fP, and \fB"uninstall"\fP, each having
their own required properties as explained below. The only valid type
for \fB"serial"\fP, is an integer, which must be monotonically
increasing as new entries are appended to the file.
.\"
.IP "\fIThe "filters" entry\fP"
.IX Action filters
.\"
A \fB"\fIFlatpak Ref Action\fP"\fP may have a \fB"filters"\fP entry which
is a JSON object with properties \fB"architectures"\fP, \fB"~architectures"\fP,
\fB"locales"\fP and \fB"~locales"\fP. Each filter property takes a JSON
array of strings containing architectures or locales to apply to the filter.
.\"
Where a filter is prefixed with a tilde (~), the action will not be applied
if the system architecture or locales matches any entry in the array. Otherwise,
the action will only be applied if the system architectures or locales matches
at least one entry in the array.
.\"
Where an action is filtered out and not applied, it will never be applied
again, even if the property being filtered on changes. For instance, if the
system locale changes, the action will not be applied on the next boot if
it could have been applied were the locale the correct value when the action
were first applied.
.\"
.IP "\fI"install" actions\fP"
.IX Install action
.\"
Where the fB"\action\fP"\fP property of a "\fBFlatpak Ref Action\fP" entry is
"\fB"install"\fP", the action will describe a flatpak that should be
installed upon the next boot of the deployment in which the action was
introduced. The entry must have the additional properties "\fB"app"\fP",
"\fB"ref-kind"\fP" and "\fB"collection-id"\fP", which describe the
flatpak app ID, whether the flatpak is a runtime or an app and the
\fBPostree\fP(1) collection-id to install the app from. See
\fPflatpak\fB(1) and \fPostree\fB(1) for more information on flatpak app IDs,
ref-kinds and collection-ids generally. If the flatpak is already installed
when the action is applied, \fBeos-updater-flatpak-installer\fP(8) will attempt
to upgrade it.
\."
Note that flatpaks are not pulled from the collection-id upon booting into
the deployment, they are instead downloaded by \fBeos-updater\fP(8) during its
"fetch" step whilst it prepares the commit to be deployed.
\."
.IP "\fI"uninstall" actions\fP"
.IX Uninstall action
.\"
Where the fB"\action\fP"\fP property of a "\fBFlatpak Ref Action\fP" entry is
"\fB"unnistall"\fP", the action will describe a flatpak that should be
uninstalled upon the next boot of the deployment in which the action was
introduced. The entry must have the additional properties "\fB"app"\fP",
"\fB"ref-kind"\fP". It is not an error if the flatpak is already uninstalled
when the action is applied.
